## Project Overview

This project contains the solution for Udacity's Hidden Markov Model Tagger Exercise under the Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree. The detailed instructions from the Assignment are below.

## Introduction

This project uses the [Pomegranate](https://github.com/jmschrei/pomegranate) library to build a hidden Markov model for part of speech tagging with a [universal tagset](http://www.petrovi.de/data/universal.pdf). Hidden Markov models have been able to achieve >96% tag accuracy with larger tagsets on realistic text corpora. Hidden Markov models have also been used for speech recognition and speech generation, machine translation, gene recognition for bioinformatics, and human gesture recognition for computer vision, and more.
